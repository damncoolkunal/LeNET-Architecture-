# LeNET-Architecture-
LeNet is a seminal work in the deep learning literature — it thoroughly demonstrated how neural networks could be trained to recognize objects in images in an end-to-end manner (i.e., no feature extraction had to take place, the network was able to learn patterns from the images themselves).
While seminal, LeNet by today’s standards is still considered a “shallow” network. With only four trainable layers (two CONV layers and two FC layers), the python lenet_mnist.pydepth of LeNet pales in comparison to the depth of current state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG (16 and 19 layers) and ResNet (100+ layers).

"python lenet_mnist.py" type in your terminal of that particular folder.
